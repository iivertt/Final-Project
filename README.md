# Final Portfolio Project – Ingrid Molina

## 👋 About Me
Hi! I'm Ingrid Molina, a 17-year-old student developer passionate about learning how technology and code can shape the world. As a high school junior, I’ve taken on the challenge of AP Computer Science and developed a deeper understanding of programming, problem-solving, and creativity through code. This portfolio is the result of a year’s worth of learning, experimentation, and growth.

## 💻 Project Overview
This final portfolio project showcases my work as a student in AP Computer Science. Throughout the year, I’ve learned how to build programs using different data types, variables, loops, conditionals, and logical thinking. I also explored web development by designing HTML/CSS projects and interactive JavaScript apps. This site is a collection of the knowledge and skills I’ve developed, and it represents my journey from beginner to confident coder.

## 🌐 Portfolio Site Features
My portfolio website includes:
- A brief introduction and bio
- A section of key topics I’ve studied in AP Computer Science
- A visual gallery of projects with hover effects and links to live demos
- Fun facts about me and highlights from my school year
- Custom styling using CSS Grid, Flexbox, and hover effects for interactive UI
